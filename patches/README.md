# Patch descriptions

## ember-sortable+2.2.1.patch

This is a backport of https://github.com/adopted-ember-addons/ember-sortable/pull/606, which
was the fix for https://github.com/adopted-ember-addons/ember-sortable/issues/640 and in turn
https://github.com/exile-center/better-trading/issues/163. It should be removed if we're ever
able to update such that we can pick up `ember-sortable@5.2.3`.
